# Teleoperation Guide

This guide explains how to set up and operate the AI Worker using teleoperation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting teleoperation, make sure:
- The follower(AI Worker) is properly set up and powered on

### Steps for Teleoperation Setup (Leader)
(*The term `Leader` refers to the control device in the AI WORKER system)
![Back of the LG2 Leader](/quick_start_guide/ai_worker/back_of_the_LG2_leader.png)
1. `Power Cable`: Connect the power adapter to supply power to the U2D2 device.
2. `U2D2 ON/OFF`: This switch is located inside a small recessed hole. The device is turned on when the inner white-dotted button is pressed.
3. `USB Cable`: Connect a USB cable from the U2D2 to one of the USB ports on the back of the `Follower`.


### How to Wear the Leader
**First Leader Version**
![Leader's wearing appearance](/quick_start_guide/ai_worker/leader_wearing_appearance.png)

1. Put both arms through the `Leader`'s `shoulder straps`.
2. Fasten the chest belt buckle and `hip belt buckle`.
3. Adjust the length of the `shoulder straps`, `chest belt`, and `hip belt` so that the `Leader` is securely fixed on your back.

**Second Leader Version**  
It can be worn more easily by users with different body types.

1. First, pull the inner belt tightly and fasten it around the waist.
2. Then, pull the outer belt and attach it over the inner belt using the Velcro.

## Running Teleoperation
The following teleoperation commands are executed on the `robot PC`.
You can either connect a keyboard and mouse directly to the Nvidia Orin, or access it via SSH (see the Setup Guide for instructions).<br>

If no containers are running when you execute `docker ps -a` on the robot PC,
start the container using:

```bash
cd ai_worker
```

```bash
./docker/container.sh start
```

If a container is already running, enter the **ai\_worker** Docker container with:

```bash
./docker/container.sh enter
```

### Option 1: All-in-One Launch

::: tip NOTICE
After execution, the follower will not move until you push both hand triggers for more than 2 seconds. Once you do, the follower will slowly move toward the leader's position, and after reaching a certain proximity, it will move more quickly. This behavior is the same even when launching the leader and follower separately.
:::

To start both the `Leader` and `Follower(BG2/SG2)` simultaneously:

:::tabs key:robot-type
== BG2 Type
ros2 launch ffw_bringup ffw_bg2_ai.launch.py
== SG2 Type
ros2 launch ffw_bringup ffw_sg2_ai.launch.py
:::

Or use the shortcut:

:::tabs key:robot-type
== BG2 Type
ffw_bg2_ai
== SG2 Type
ffw_sg2_ai
:::

### Option 2: Separate Launches
If you want to run the `Leader` and `Follower` separately in different terminals:

1. **Launch the teleoperation `Follower`**:
:::tabs key:robot-type
== BG2 Type
ros2 launch ffw_bringup ffw_bg2_follower_ai.launch.py
== SG2 Type
ros2 launch ffw_bringup ffw_sg2_follower_ai.launch.py
:::

Or use the shortcut:

:::tabs key:robot-type
== BG2 Type
ffw_bg2_follower_ai
== SG2 Type
ffw_sg2_follower_ai
:::

If you want to run the system without launching the cameras, you can set the `launch_cameras` parameter to `false`:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch ffw_bringup ffw_bg2_follower_ai.launch.py launch_cameras:=false
   ```

2. **Launch the teleoperation `Leader`**:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch ffw_bringup ffw_lg2_leader_ai.launch.py
   ```

   Or use the shortcut:
   ```bash
   ffw_lg2_leader_ai
   ```

## Basic Operation
::: tip NOTICE
You must push **both hand triggers** for more than 2 seconds for the follower to start moving. When you push both triggers forward, the follower will slowly move to the leader's position, and once it comes within a certain error range, it will move quickly.

* FFW_BG2
1. Once both systems are running, the `Follower` will begin to mirror your movements.
2. Start with slow, gentle movements to get familiar with the response.
3. The grip buttons on the `Leader` control the gripper actions on the `Follower`.
4. The `right joystick` controls the up and down motion of the `lift`,
while the `left joystick` controls the`head` section of the robot.

* FFW_SG2
1. Once both systems are running, the `Follower` will begin to mirror your movements.
2. Start with slow, gentle movements to get familiar with the response.
3. The grip buttons on the `Leader` control the gripper actions on the `Follower`.
4. The `right joystick` controls the up and down motion of the `lift`,
while the `left joystick` controls the`head` section of the robot.
5. Pressing both switches simultaneously switches to `SWERVE DRIVE MODE`.
6. In `SWERVE DRIVE MODE`, the left joystick controls: X-axis: Linear x, Y-axis: Linear y
   The right joystick controls: Y-axis: Angular z

::: warning
In swerve mode, the arms continue to move. Please be careful.

## Pause Teleoperation

To temporarily pause teleoperation:
1. Push both hand triggers for more than 2 seconds
2. The follower will stop and hold its current position

## Stopping Teleoperation

To stop teleoperation:
1. Return to a neutral position or pause the system.
2. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the launch file is running.

## Troubleshooting

- **Delayed movements**: Check for any obstructions or if you're reaching joint limits
- **Unresponsive gripper**: Ensure proper calibration and connection
- **System unresponsive**: Check ROS topic connections with `ros2 topic list` and `ros2 topic echo`
- **Trigger pause function not available or robot moves immediately upon startup**: Please update the ai_worker source code to version `1.1.10` or higher
