# Model Inference

The following sections describe how to run inference using your trained imitation learning model. You can perform inference either through the Web GUI or the LeRobot CLI. After running inference, you can visualize the results to evaluate how your policy performed.

## 1. Web UI (Physical AI Manager) – *Recommended*

You can run inference directly through the Web UI provided by the Physical AI Manager.

## Visualizing Inference Results

After running inference, you can inspect the result data visually to verify how your policy behaved.
