# About ROBOTIS Hand

<img src="/hx5_d20_rev2.png" width="500"/>

The **ROBOTIS HX Hand** series marks the future of robotic manipulation, blending mechanical precision with advanced intelligence. Built on the foundation of our reliable Dynamixel Smart Actuators, the ROBOTIS Hand utilizes a human hand-mimicking structure integrated with cutting-edge Physical AI. This design allows the hand to move beyond simple grasping. It actively perceives object texture and shape, enabling it to perform complex high-dexterity tasks with precision.
