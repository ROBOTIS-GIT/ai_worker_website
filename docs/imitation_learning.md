# Imitation Learning

## Overview

### General Information

The dataset follows the standard [ðŸ¤— Hugging Face datasets format](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) and contains imitation learning demonstrations collected from the AI Worker via ROS 2 teleoperation using the [lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) framework.

### Tutorial Video: End-to-End Imitation Learning Workflow

The following video demonstrates the complete process of recording a dataset with AI Worker, from teleoperation to dataset creation to inference using a model trained on the collected data:
