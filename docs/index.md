features:
  - title: Physical AI-based Human Action Imitation Learning
    details: The AI Worker, grounded in Physical AI technology, features Imitation Learning as its core, learning tasks by interacting with the real environment through human demonstration. This enables intuitive teaching of new skills to the robot and flexible adaptation to various environmental changes.
    icon: ðŸ§ 
  - title: Real-time Intelligent Task Performance
    details: The robot perceives its surrounding environment in real-time and infers its next actions based on learned intelligence to perform tasks immediately. This ensures high applicability in complex and dynamic real-world work environments.
    icon: âš¡
  - title: High-DOF Dual-Arm & Dexterous Hand System
    details: The high-performance hands, targeting 16 to 20 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) per hand, implement high dexterity with each finger having 3 DOF. This, along with 7-DOF dual arms, enables human-like, highly precise and complex object manipulation and tasks, contributing to automating delicate processes in various industrial sites.
