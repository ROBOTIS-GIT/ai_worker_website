## Overview of the ROBOTIS Physical AI Lineup
<img src="/overview/physical_ai_lineup.png" alt="ROBOTIS Physical AI Lineup" style="border-radius: 12px; width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Progressing toward advanced Physical AI through a scalable research lineup</em></p>

The ROBOTIS Physical AI Lineup consists of three scalable levels of research-focused robots:
- `Level 3 (Enterprise):` **AI Worker**: Semi-humanoid robot systems
- `Level 2 (Middle):` **OMY**: Advanced AI Manipulators
- `Level 1 (Entry):` **OMX**: Cost-effective AI Manipulators [**Coming Soon**]

Each level supports a progressive research journey in Physical AI. It begins with basic motion learning and continues through full-body imitation to autonomous operation.

## What is Physical AI?

`Physical AI` refers to artificial intelligence that learns and acts through **real-world physical interaction** using robotic bodies.

Unlike traditional AI, which operates purely in simulation or digital environments, Physical AI:
- Receives feedback through motion, contact, and force
- Learns by interacting with the environment in real time
- Uses robotic hardware to sense, move, and adapt

This approach enables learning that is grounded in reality â€” shaped by friction, gravity, uncertainty, and the complexity of the `physical world`.

`Physical AI` allows us to:
- Train robots to perform real-world tasks with precision
- Collect meaningful demonstrations through human guidance (teleoperation, VR)
- Deploy policies that bridge simulation and reality

By embedding intelligence into physical systems, we open the door to AI that can not only understand the world, but also act in it safely and effectively.
