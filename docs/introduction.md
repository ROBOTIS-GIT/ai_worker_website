# ROBOTIS Physical AI Lineup<br>: AI Worker & AI Manipulator Series

We offer a complete lineup of research-friendly robots for **Physical AI development** — from affordable manipulators to semi humanoid platforms.

## 1. Overview of the ROBOTIS Physical AI Lineup

The ROBOTIS Physical AI Lineup consists of three scalable levels of research-focused robots:

- `Level 1` **OMX-AI**: Cost-effective AI Manipulators [**Coming Soon**]
- `Level 2` **OMY-AI**: Advanced AI Manipulators
- `Level 3` **AI Worker**: Semi-humanoid robot systems

Each level supports a progressive research journey in Physical AI — from basic motion learning to full-body imitation and autonomous operation.

## 2. What is Physical AI?

`Physical AI` refers to artificial intelligence that learns and acts through **real-world physical interaction** using robotic bodies.

Unlike traditional AI, which operates purely in simulation or digital environments, Physical AI:
- Receives feedback through motion, contact, and force
- Learns by interacting with the environment in real time
- Uses robotic hardware to sense, move, and adapt

This approach enables learning that is grounded in reality — shaped by friction, gravity, uncertainty, and the complexity of the `physical world`.

`Physical AI` allows us to:
- Train robots to perform real-world tasks with precision
- Collect meaningful demonstrations through human guidance (teleoperation, VR)
- Deploy policies that bridge simulation and reality

> By embedding intelligence into physical systems, we open the door to AI that can not only understand the world — but act in it safely and effectively.
