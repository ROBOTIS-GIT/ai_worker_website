# About OMX

<img src="/quick_start_guide/omx/main_image.webp" width="600"/>

The ROBOTIS **OMX** is an entry‑level Physical AI manipulator designed for hands‑on dataset collection and comparison, helping newcomers step into Physical AI with confidence. This compact 5‑DOF platform, built on **DYNAMIXEL‑X**, supports end‑to‑end IL/RL pipelines and **ROS 2‑native** workflows.

### ⚙️ No Motor Setup
All motor parameters are preconfigured at the factory—no hardware or software setup required. You can connect immediately and start using the robot arm without any additional preparation.

### 🔌 No Calibration
Every DYNAMIXEL actuator is factory-calibrated, so users never need to perform calibration themselves. Both hardware and software are fully supported, making it a true plug-and-play experience, even when using LeRobot.

### 🛡️ Safe Bring-Up with Homing
The follower arm can safely return to its initial pose from any position during bring-up. This ensures stable, predictable operation and minimizes risks, even for first-time users.

### 🧭 Extended Position Base
The base motor uses an extended-position design, providing full 360° rotation. With extended cabling, it can rotate indefinitely—expanding the usable workspace for more flexible manipulation.

### 🪶 Lightweight
OMX is engineered to be extremely lightweight, allowing it to be carried easily and deployed anywhere. The reduced weight also means less fatigue during extended use while maintaining robust performance.

### ✨ Low-Friction Leader
A special low-friction design makes the leader smooth and easy to operate. Even children can control it safely, and fine movements feel natural with minimal effort.

### 🔋 Powerless Leader
Unlike conventional robot arms, the leader works with just a single USB-C connection. This enables simple laptop use for simulation or quick trials without requiring external power supplies.

### 🎯 Spring Gripper
A spring-assisted control mechanism provides a comfortable, repeatable grip. Users experience consistent tactile feedback, making long data-collection sessions easier and less fatiguing.

### 🎛️ Design for Improving UX
Thoughtful details improve real-world performance, from a opened gripper design that reduces occlusion to a clear base point for initial poses. These features ensure consistent data, better labeling, and reproducibility across sessions.

### 🤖 Supported ROS2
OMX officially supports ROS2, with compatibility across existing packages. Developers can integrate with ROS2-based software stacks to unlock advanced robotics functions.

### 🔄 AI Workflows
Fully compatible with ROBOTIS Physical AI Tools and native LeRobot workflows. Users can choose either environment and seamlessly build a wide range of AI-driven applications out of the box.
