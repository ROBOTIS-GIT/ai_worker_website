# Dataset Preparation

The following sections describe the dataset preparation workflow for Imitation Learning, which consists of two main stages: **Dataset Recording** and **Dataset Visualization**.
The recording stage explains how to collect data using either the Web GUI or the LeRobot CLI.
The visualization stage focuses on verifying data quality by allowing users to inspect the recorded dataset.

## Dataset Recording

You can record your own dataset using **one of the following methods**:

### 1. Web UI (Physical AI Manager) – *Recommended*

You can record your dataset using the Web UI provided by the Physical AI Manager.

### 2. LeRobot CLI – *Deprecated (legacy use only)*

This method is no longer officially supported, but remains available for legacy users or automated workflows.
