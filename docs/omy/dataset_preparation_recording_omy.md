# Dataset Preparation - Recording

## Before Recording

### 1. Open the Web UI

#### a. Access the Web UI in Your Browser
Please enter the IP address of the PC running **Physical AI Server** (`physical_ai_server_bringup.launch.py` or `ai_server`) into your web browser.  

::: tip
If you are running the **Physical AI Server** and opening the web browser on the same computer,<br>you can simply enter `http://localhost`

:::

##### For example:
- If the PC running **Physical AI Server** has IP address 192.168.0.105<br>Access `http://192.168.0.105` as shown below:

<div class="UI" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
  <img src="/imitation_learning/web_ui_url_omy.png" alt="Web UI" style="width: 100%; ">
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Enter the IP Address</em></p>

- Once accessed, the following screen will appear with the `Disconnected` status.

  <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Initial Screen</em></p>


### 2. Select the Robot Type

On the **Home** page, select the type of robot you are using.

<div class="UI" style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;">
  <img src="/imitation_learning/web_ui_robot_type_selection.png" alt="Web UI" style="width: 100%; ">
</div>

After clicking the `Set Robot Type` button, the status will change to `Connected`.

  <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Connected Screen</em></p>  

### 3. Go to `Record` page

::: info
You cannot access **Record** page unless a robot type has been selected on the **Home** page.
Please ensure that the robot type is selected before proceeding.
:::

After the status changes to `Connected`, you can access the **Record** page using the button on the left sidebar, as shown below.

<img src="/imitation_learning/web_ui_record_page.png" alt="Web UI" style="width: 100%; ">
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Record Screen</em></p>

The **Record** page is divided into three main sections:

- **Image Streaming Area** (Center): Displays real-time camera streams from the robot.

- **Task Info Panel** (Right side): Enter task name, task instruction, time values, etc.

- **Control Panel** (Bottom): Start/stop recording and manage data collection.

The selected robot type is also displayed in the top left corner.

### 4. Visualize RGB Images

The image stream is displayed automatically upon entering the **Record** page.
You can remove the current stream and select a different one as needed.

To change the image topic:

1. Click the `+` button in the **Image Streaming Area**.
2. Choose a topic from the popup window.

  <img src="/imitation_learning/web_ui_select_image_topic.png" alt="Web UI" style="width: 100%; ">
</div>

### 5. Enter Task Information

Fill out the task-related fields in the **Task Info Panel**, as shown below. For more information about what each field means in the **Task Info Panel**, please refer to **:point_right: Task Information Field Descriptions** below.

::: details :point_right: Task Information Field Descriptions
|Item|Description|
|---|---|
| **Task Name** | It is used for the folder name of the dataset |
| **Task Instruction** | It is a sentence that instructs the robot what action to perform, such as ***"pick and place object"***. <br> In **multi-task** mode, you can add Task Instructions by clicking the Add Instruction button. |
| **Push to hub** | If you want to push the dataset to the Hugging Face Hub, check this box. This allows sharing and training. <br>**To push to the Hugging Face Hub, you need to:**<br>1. Have a Hugging Face account<br>2. Have the necessary permissions to push to the repository |
| **Private Mode** | Only available when "Push to hub" is checked. Keeps your dataset private on Hugging Face. |
| **User ID** | Your Hugging Face account username, also used as the folder name for the dataset.<br>- If **not** using Hugging Face, you can use any name.<br>- If using Hugging Face, click `Load` to select from registered User IDs.<br>- If no User IDs or want a different one, click `Change` and enter your Hugging Face token.<br>- The Hugging Face token must have both **read** and **write** permissions enabled.<img src="/imitation_learning/web_ui_enter_hf_token.png" alt="Web UI" style="width: 100%; "><br>- If you have a registered account but haven't checked "Push to hub", you can either:<br>1. Load a registered User ID<br>2. Manually enter any User ID  |
| **FPS** | Frame rate for dataset recording. Recommended value is 15.|
| **Tags** | Keywords to categorize and organize your dataset in the hub. Multiple tags can be added. Useful for searching or filtering later. |
| **Warmup Time** | Duration (in seconds) to warm up the robot before starting the recording |
| **Episode Time** | Duration (in seconds) to record each episode |
| **Reset Time** | Time allocated (in seconds) for resetting between episodes |
| **Num Episodes** | Total number of episodes to record |
| **Optimized Save** | If enabled, uses RAM for faster dataset encoding processing |

You are now ready to start recording your dataset.

## Start Recording

To begin recording, use the **Control Panel** located at the bottom of the **Record** page:

:::tabs
== Single Task Record
  <img src="/imitation_learning/web_ui_control_panel.png" alt="Web UI" style="width: 100%; ">

### Step 1: Click the `Start` Button

Click the `Start` button to begin the recording session. The system will automatically:

   - Warm up the robot for the specified **Warm-up Time**
   - Record each episode for the specified **Episode Time**
   - Wait for the specified **Reset Time** between episodes
   - Repeat the above steps for the specified **Number of Episodes**

### Step 2: Monitor and Control During Recording


While recording is in progress, the following controls are available:

   - The `Stop` button saves the current episode in progress and stops the recording. If you press the `Start` button again, recording will resume from the next episode
   - The `Retry` button cancels the current episode and restarts recording for that episode
   - The `Next` button ends the current episode early and moves to the next episode
   - The `Finish` button ends the recording session and saves the current dataset, regardless of the remaining number of episodes

### Step 1: Click the `Start` Button

Click the `Start` button to begin the recording session. The system will automatically:

   - Warm up the robot for the specified **Warm-up Time**
   - Start recording the first task 
   - The `Episode` counter increments by 1 each time a task is completed.
   - After completing all tasks, the `Scenario` counter increments by 1 and the cycle returns to the first task.

### Step 2: Monitor and Control During Recording


While recording is in progress, the following controls are available:

   - The `Stop` button stops the current recording task. If you press the `Start` button again, recording will resume from the next task
   - The `Skip Task` button cancels the current task and move to the next task
   - The `Retry` button cancels the current task and restarts recording for that task
   - The `Next` button ends the current task and moves to the next task
   - The `Finish` button ends the recording session and saves the dataset

## After Recording
   - The dataset will be saved on the **host machine**.
   - If **"Push to Hub"** is enabled, the dataset will be uploaded to Hugging Face.
   - You can access the recorded dataset at the following path from from the **host environment** or **Docker container**:

`USER PC`
```bash
<your_workspace>/physical_ai_tools/docker/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/
```
or

`USER PC` `üêã PHYSICAL AI TOOLS`
```bash
${HOME}/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/
```
