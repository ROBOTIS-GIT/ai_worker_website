# Simulation

## Overview
This simulation environment is designed to test the AI Worker in a controlled setting, allowing for the evaluation of its capabilities in a variety of tasks. The simulation is built using ROS 2, Google Deepmind's MuJoCo and NVIDIA Issac Sim.

## Simulation environments for Reinforcement Learning
The simulation environments are designed to facilitate reinforcement learning (RL) training and evaluation. They provide a realistic setting for the AI Worker to learn and adapt its behaviors through interaction with the environment.

# URDF, SDF model for Gazebo Sim and RViz
The AI Worker simulation model is available in URDF and SDF formats, which can be used in Gazebo and RViz for visualization and simulation purposes. These models include all the necessary components of the AI Worker, such as the mobile base, dual arms, and sensors.
